Problem 6
=========


   The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

                          1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

   The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

                       (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

   Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
   natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

   Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
   hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Problem 12
==========


   The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural
   numbers. So the 7^th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 =
   28. The first ten terms would be:

                    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

   Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

     Â 1: 1
     Â 3: 1,3
     Â 6: 1,2,3,6
     10: 1,2,5,10
     15: 1,3,5,15
     21: 1,3,7,21
     28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

   We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five
   divisors.

   What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
   divisors?

Problem 14

   The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive
   integers:

   n â†’ n/2 (n is even)
   n â†’ 3n + 1 (n is odd)

   Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
   sequence:

                   13 â†’ 40 â†’ 20 â†’ 10 â†’ 5 â†’ 16 â†’ 8 â†’ 4 â†’ 2 â†’ 1

   It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
   contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem),
   it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

   Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

   NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

   Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than
   n which divide evenly into n).
   If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair
   and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

   For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
   44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,
   2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

   Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

   A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
   exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors
   of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect
   number.

   A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less
   than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

   As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the
   smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is
   24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater
   than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However,
   this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it
   is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of
   two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

   Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the
   sum of two abundant numbers.

   Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

                                  nÂ² + n + 41

   It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
   values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41
   is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41Â² + 41 + 41 is clearly
   divisible by 41.

   The incredible formula Â nÂ² âˆ’ 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80
   primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the
   coefficients, âˆ’79 and 1601, is âˆ’126479.

   Considering quadratics of the form:

     nÂ² + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000

     where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
     e.g. |11| = 11 and |âˆ’4| = 4

   The cards are valued in the order:

   If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the
   highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives
   (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players
   have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see

   If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.

   Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

   349 + 943 = 1292,
   1292 + 2921 = 4213
   4213 + 3124 = 7337

   That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.

   Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like
   196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome
   through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the
   theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem,
   we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In
   addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will
   either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no
   one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map
   it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to
   require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome:
   4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).

              âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...

   By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

   1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
   1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
   1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
   1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...

   The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth
   expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in
   the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

   In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a
   numerator with more digits than denominator?

   It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
   diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
   lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

   If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square

   what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes

Problem 59
==========


   Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred
   standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).
   For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.

   A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to
   ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The
   advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on
   the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107,
   then 107 XOR 42 = 65.

   For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
   message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the
   encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and
   without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.

   Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified
   method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the
   message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the
   message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password
   key for security, but short enough to be memorable.

   Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three
   lower case characters. Using [1]cipher1.txt, a file containing the
   encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain
   common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII
   values in the original text.

   The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two
   primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be
   prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The
   sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four
   primes with this property.

   All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can
   be written in the form:

   âˆšN = a[0] +            1
   Â            a[1] +         1
   Â            Â       a[2] +     1
   Â            Â       Â       a[3] + ...

   For example, let us consider âˆš23:

   âˆš23 = 4 + âˆš23 â€” 4 = 4 +Â    1   Â = 4 +Â       1
   Â                           1   Â        1 +Â  âˆš23 â€“ 3
                            âˆš23â€”4                 7

   If we continue we would get the following expansion:

   âˆš23 = 4 +          1
   Â          1 +        1
   Â          Â    3 +      1

   The process can be summarised as follows:

   It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the

   The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.

   âˆš2 = 1 +          1
   Â         2 +        1
   Â         Â    2 +      1
   Â         Â    Â    2 +    1
   Â         Â    Â    Â    2 + ...

   The infinite continued fraction can be written, âˆš2 = [1;(2)], (2)
   indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, âˆš23 =
   [4;(1,3,1,8)].

   It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions
   for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider
   the convergents for âˆš2.

   1 + 1 = 3/2
   Â    2 Â 

   1 +   1   = 7/5
   Â    2 + 1
   Â    Â    2 Â 

   1 +     1     = 17/12
   Â    2 +   1   Â 
   Â    Â    2 + 1 Â 
   Â    Â    Â    2 Â 

   1 +       1       = 41/29
   Â    2 +     1
   Â    Â    2 +   1   Â 
   Â    Â    Â    2 + 1 Â 
   Â    Â    Â    Â    2 Â 

   Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for âˆš2 are:

   1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378,
   ...

   What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
   e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2k,1, ...].

   The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:

   2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536, ...

   The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10^th convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.

   Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100^th convergent of the

   Euler's Totient function, Ï†(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is
   used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n
   which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are
   all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, Ï†(9)=6.
   The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive
   number, so Ï†(1)=1.

   Interestingly, Ï†(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a
   permutation of 79180.

   Find the value of n, 1 < n < 10^7, for which Ï†(n) is a permutation of n

   The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the
   factorial of its digits is equal to 145:

   1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

   Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of
   numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such
   loops that exist:

   169 â†’ 363601 â†’ 1454 â†’ 169
   871 â†’ 45361 â†’ 871
   872 â†’ 45362 â†’ 872

   It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually
   get stuck in a loop. For example,

                G2J  F3  U2   F2  F1  R3  E3  E2   CH2  E1  FP

   A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice
   to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction.
   Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal
   probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community
   chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.

   In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the
   player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive
   doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they
   proceed directly to jail.

   At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a
   player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective
   pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom
   of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of
   this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any
   instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player
   will remain on the CC/CH square.

     â€¢Â Community Chest (2/16 cards):

        Â 1.Â Advance to GO
        Â 2.Â Go to JAIL

     â€¢Â Chance (10/16 cards):

        Â 1.Â Advance to GO
        Â 2.Â Go to JAIL
        Â 3.Â Go to C1
        Â 4.Â Go to E3
        Â 5.Â Go to H2

        Â 7.Â Go to next R (railway company)
        Â 8.Â Go to next R
        Â 9.Â Go to next U (utility company)
        10.Â Go back 3 squares.

   The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular
   square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll.
   For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for
   which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have
   the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and
   it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we
   are interested in. We shall make no distinction between "Just Visiting"
   and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring
   a double to "get out of jail", assuming that they pay to get out on their
   next turn.

   By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we
   can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond
   with sets of squares.

   Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in
   order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO
   (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed
   with the six-digit modal string: 102400.

   If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the
   six-digit modal string.

   k=3: 6 = 1 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 = 1 + 2 + 3
   k=4: 8 = 1 Ã— 1 Ã— 2 Ã— 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4

   4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.

   In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2â‰¤kâ‰¤12 is
   {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.

   What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2â‰¤kâ‰¤12000?

   The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing each
   number (see [1]About Roman Numerals...). However, there is always a "best"
   way of writing a particular number.

   For example, the following represent all of the legitimate ways of writing
   the number sixteen:

   IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
   VIIIIIIIIIII
   VVIIIIII
   XIIIIII
   VVVI
   XVI

   The last example being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least
   number of numerals.

   The 11K text file, [2]roman.txt, contains one thousand numbers written in
   valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; that is, they are
   arranged in descending units and obey the subtractive pair rule (see
   [3]About Roman Numerals... for the definitive rules for this problem).

   Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their
   minimal form.

   Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no
   more than four consecutive identical units.

Problem 90
==========


   Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on
   it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes
   side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit
   numbers.

   For example, the square number 64 could be formed:

   In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to
   display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25,
   36, 49, 64, and 81.

   For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
   on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.

   However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned
   upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3,
   4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it
   would be impossible to obtain 09.

   In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on
   each cube, not the order.

   {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}
   {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}

   But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets
   in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
   for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.

   How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the
   square numbers to be displayed?

   A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits
   in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

   For example,

   85 â†’ 89 â†’ 145 â†’ 42 â†’ 20 â†’ 4 â†’ 16 â†’ 37 â†’ 58 â†’ 89

   Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an

   By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and
   making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, âˆ’, *, /) and
   brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer
   targets.

   For example,

   8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
   14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
   19 = 4 * (2 + 3) âˆ’ 1
   36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)

   Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.

   Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different
   target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28
   can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.

   Find the set of four distinct digits, a < b < c < d, for which the longest
   set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n, can be obtained, giving your

   The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number
   itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As
   the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.

   Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of
   the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For
   this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.

   Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with
   12496, we form a chain of five numbers:

             12496 â†’ 14288 â†’ 15472 â†’ 14536 â†’ 14264 (â†’ 12496 â†’ ...)

   Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable

Problem 101
===========


   If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible
   to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely
   many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.

   As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is
   defined by the generating function,
   u[n] = n^3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...

   Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working
   on the principle that "simple is best" we should assume a linear
   relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7).
   Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same
   principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.

   We shall define OP(k, n) to be the n^th term of the optimum polynomial
   generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be
   clear that OP(k, n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for
   n â‰¤ k, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k, k+1);
   in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).

   As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be
   most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n â‰¥ 2, OP(1, n) = u[1].

   Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:

   OP(1, n) = 1               1, 1, 1, 1, ...
   OP(2, n) = 7nâˆ’6            1, 8, 15, ...
   OP(3, n) = 6n^2âˆ’11n+6Â Â Â Â Â  1, 8, 27, 58, ...
   OP(4, n) = n^3             1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...

   Clearly no BOPs exist for k â‰¥ 4.

   By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in red
   above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.

   Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:

      u[n] = 1 âˆ’ n + n^2 âˆ’ n^3 + n^4 âˆ’ n^5 + n^6 âˆ’ n^7 + n^8 âˆ’ n^9 + n^10

   next optimum set is of the form B = {b, a[1]+b, a[2]+b, ... ,a[n]+b},
   where b is the "middle" element on the previous row.

   For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly
   increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

   Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained
   from a set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for
   equality (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966
   subset pairs need to be tested.

   For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need
   to be tested for equality?

   NOTE: This problem is related to [1]Problem 103 and [2]Problem 105.

   However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and
   still ensure that all points on the network remain connected. The network
   which achieves the maximum saving is shown below. It has a weight of 93,
   representing a saving of 243 âˆ’ 93 = 150 from the original network.

   Using [1]network.txt, a 6K text file containing a network with forty
   vertices, and given in matrix form, find the maximum saving which can be
   achieved by removing redundant edges whilst ensuring that the network
   remains connected.

Problem 109
===========


   In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which
   is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.

   The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the
   dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores
   zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single
   scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and
   treble scores respectively.

   At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull
   region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull
   is a double, worth 50 points.

   There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the
   players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce
   their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a
   "doubles out" system, which means that the player must land a double
   (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final
   dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one
   or lower means the score for that set of three darts is "bust".

   When a player is able to finish on their current score it is called a
   "checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s
   and double bull).

   There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:

   Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on
   different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the
   same as T1 S1 D1.

   In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for
   example, D3 is the same as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.

   Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.

   How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?

   It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and
   this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct

Problem 111
===========


   Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that
   they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by
   22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:

              1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111

   We shall say that M(n, d) represents the maximum number of repeated digits
   for an n-digit prime where d is the repeated digit, N(n, d) represents the
   number of such primes, and S(n, d) represents the sum of these primes.

   So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit
   prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes,
   and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for d =
   0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are
   N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.

   In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.

                   â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”

Problem 112
===========


   Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
   left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

   Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a
   decreasing number; for example, 66420.

   We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing
   a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

   Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just
   over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the
   least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50%
   is 538.

   Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time
   we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.

   Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is
   exactly 99%.

Problem 115

   NOTE: This is a more difficult version of [1]Problem 114.

   A row measuring n units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of
   m units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to
   be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.

   Let the fill-count function, F(m, n), represent the number of ways that a
   row can be filled.

   For example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.

   That is, for m = 3, it can be seen that n = 30 is the smallest value for
   which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

   In the same way, for m = 10, it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711
   and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so n = 57 is the least value for which the
   fill-count function first exceeds one million.

   For m = 50, find the least value of n for which the fill-count function
   first exceeds one million.

   A bag contains one red disc and one blue disc. In a game of chance a
   player takes a disc at random and its colour is noted. After each turn the
   disc is returned to the bag, an extra red disc is added, and another disc
   is taken at random.

   The player pays Â£1 to play and wins if they have taken more blue discs
   than red discs at the end of the game.

   If the game is played for four turns, the probability of a player winning
   is exactly 11/120, and so the maximum prize fund the banker should
   allocate for winning in this game would be Â£10 before they would expect to
   incur a loss. Note that any payout will be a whole number of pounds and
   also includes the original Â£1 paid to play the game, so in the example
   given the player actually wins Â£9.

   Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated to a single game in
   which fifteen turns are played.

   n^3 Ã— n^3 = n^6
   n^6 Ã— n^6 = n^12

   The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid

   If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six
   cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require
   seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and
   eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.

   However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5Â xÂ 1Â xÂ 1 also requires
   twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring
   5Â xÂ 3Â xÂ 1, 7Â xÂ 2Â xÂ 1, and 11Â xÂ 1Â xÂ 1 all contain forty-six cubes.

   We shall define C(n) to represent the number of cuboids that contain n
   cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118)
   = 8.

   It turns out that 154 is the least value of n for which C(n) = 10.

   We shall define the triplet of positive integers (a, b, c) to be an

   Â 2.Â a < b
   Â 3.Â a + b = c
   Â 4.Â rad(abc) < c

   Â 2.Â 5 < 27
   Â 3.Â 5 + 27 = 32

   numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below shows
   the first three rings.

   By finding the difference between tile n and each its six neighbours we
   shall define PD(n) to be the number of those differences which are prime.

   For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29,
   11, 6, 1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.

   In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11, and
   10, hence PD(17) = 2.

   It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(n) is 3.

   If all of the tiles for which PD(n) = 3 are listed in ascending order to
   form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.

   Find the 2000th tile in this sequence.

   A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
   R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.

   Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown
   that there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is divisible by n, and
   let A(n) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) =
   5.

   The least value of n for which A(n) first exceeds ten is 17.

   Find the least value of n for which A(n) first exceeds one-million.

   17.

   By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the

   With b = 272 and L = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the base
   length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the
   property that h = b Â± 1.

   square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by 5
   square can be tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares.

   However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the hole would measure 7
   by 7 and these could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square.

   A positive integer, n, is divided by d and the quotient and remainder are

   Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120
   degrees. Let X be any point inside the triangle and let XA = p, XC = q,
   and XB = r.

   Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that p + q + r
   was minimised.

   Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC and
   AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed
   circles of AOB, BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside
   the triangle. Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat
   point, minimises p + q + r. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that
   when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO = p + q + r and that AN, BM and CO
   also intersect at T.

   If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive integers
   we shall call triangle ABC a Torricelli triangle. For example, a = 399, b
   = 455, c = 511 is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with p + q + r =
   784.

Problem 144
===========


   In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay
   line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the
   mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.

   The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the
   equation 4x^2 + y^2 = 100

   The section corresponding to âˆ’0.01 â‰¤ x â‰¤ +0.01 at the top is missing,
   allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.

   The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside
   the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6).

   Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the
   usual law of reflection "angle of incidence equals angle of reflection."
   That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with
   the normal line at the point of incidence.

   In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of
   contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue
   line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of
   the first bounce.

   The slope m of the tangent line at any point (x,y) of the given ellipse
   is: m = âˆ’4x/y

   The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of
   incidence.

   The animation on the right shows the first 10 reflections of the beam.

   How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell
   before exiting?

   Now, let us repeat the search, but on a much larger scale:

   First, generate four million pseudo-random numbers using a specific form
   of what is known as a "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":

   For 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 55, s[k] = [100003 âˆ’ 200003k + 300007k^3] (modulo 1000000) âˆ’
   500000.
   For 56 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 4000000, s[k] = [s[kâˆ’24] + s[kâˆ’55] + 1000000] (modulo
   1000000) âˆ’ 500000.

   Thus, s[10] = âˆ’393027 and s[100] = 86613.

   The terms of s are then arranged in a 2000Ã—2000 table, using the first
   2000 numbers to fill the first row (sequentially), the next 2000 numbers
   to fill the second row, and so on.

   Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in any
   direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).

Problem 150
===========


   In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find a
   sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the smallest
   possible.

   In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle
   satisfies this condition having a sum of âˆ’42.

   We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we
   generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers s[k] in the range Â±2^19, using a
   type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator)
   as follows:

   t := 0
   for k = 1 up to k = 500500:
   Â  Â  t := (615949*t + 797807) modulo 2^20
   Â  Â  s[k] := tâˆ’2^19

   Thus: s[1] = 273519, s[2] = âˆ’153582, s[3] = 450905 etc

   Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers thus:

                                      s[1]
                                   s[2]Â  s[3]
                               s[4]Â  s[5]Â  s[6]Â 
                            s[7]Â  s[8]Â  s[9]Â  s[10]
                                      ...

   Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as far
   as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the next
   row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and so
   on).
   The "sum of a sub-triangle" is defined as the sum of all the elements it
   contains.
   Find the smallest possible sub-triangle sum.

Problem 151
===========


   A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires
   a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.

   Every Monday morning, the foreman opens a new envelope, containing a large
   sheet of the special paper with size A1.

   He proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then he
   cuts one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until he
   obtains the A5-size sheet needed for the first batch of the week.

   All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.

   At the beginning of each subsequent batch, he takes from the envelope one
   sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, he uses it. If it is
   larger, he repeats the 'cut-in-half' procedure until he has what he needs
   and any remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.

   Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number
   of times (during each week) that the foreman finds a single sheet of paper
   in the envelope.

   Give your answer rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxxÂ .

   There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares
   using distinct integers.

   For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35} can be used:

   In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive, there are exactly
   three ways to do it, the remaining two being:
   {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45} and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}.

Problem 153
===========


   As we all know the equation x^2=-1 has no solutions for real x.
   If we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two
   solutions: x=i and x=-i.
   If we go a step further the equation (x-3)^2=-4 has two complex solutions:
   x=3+2i and x=3-2i.
   x=3+2i and x=3-2i are called each others' complex conjugate.
   Numbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.
   In general a+bi and aâˆ’bi are each other's complex conjugate.

   A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are
   integers.
   The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).
   To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b â‰  0 we call such
   integers "rational integers."
   A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the
   result is also a Gaussian integer.
   If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify in the following
   manner:
   Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1âˆ’2i.
   The result is .
   So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.
   Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because .
   Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational
   integer n, then its complex conjugate (aâˆ’bi) is also a divisor of n.

   In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 +
   2i, 1 âˆ’ 2i, 2 + i, 2 âˆ’ i, 5}.
   The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five
   positive rational integers:

Problem 154
===========


   A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each
   ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.

   Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each
   position:

   A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three
   spheres directly below the current position.

   Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum
   of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there are
   up to three numbers above it).

   The result is Pascal's pyramid and the numbers at each level n are the
   coefficients of the trinomial expansion (x + y + z)^n.

   How many coefficients in the expansion of (x + y + z)^200000 are multiples
   of 10^12?

Problem 155
===========


   An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same
   value C.
   The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form
   sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other
   capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a
   final circuit.

   Using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make
   circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example,
   using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 F each, we can obtain the following 7
   distinct total capacitance values:

   If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we
   can obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple
   procedure described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ...

   Find D(18).

   Reminder : When connecting capacitors C[1], C[2] etc in parallel, the
   total capacitance is C[T]Â =Â C[1]Â +Â C[2]Â +...,
   whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given

   Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base 10 like
   this:
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12....

   Consider the digit d=1. After we write down each number n, we will update
   the number of ones that have occurred and call this number f(n,1). The
   first values for f(n,1), then, are as follows:

                                   n  f(n,1)
                                   0  0
                                   1  1
                                   2  1
                                   3  1
                                   4  1
                                   5  1
                                   6  1
                                   7  1
                                   8  1
                                   9  1
                                   10 2
                                   11 4
                                   12 5

   Note that f(n,1) never equals 3.
   So the first two solutions of the equation f(n,1)=n are n=0 and n=1. The
   next solution is n=199981.

   In the same manner the function f(n,d) gives the total number of digits d
   that have been written down after the number n has been written.
   In fact, for every digit d â‰  0, 0 is the first solution of the equation
   f(n,d)=n.

   Let s(d) be the sum of all the solutions for which f(n,d)=n.
   You are given that s(1)=22786974071.

   Find âˆ‘ s(d) for 1 â‰¤ d â‰¤ 9.

   Note: if, for some n, f(n,d)=n for more than one value of d this value of
   n is counted again for every value of d for which f(n,d)=n.

   Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet,
   character strings of length three can be formed.
   Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
   When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters
   come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
   For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically
   after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters that
   come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
   In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character
   comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.

   We now consider strings of n â‰¤ 26 different characters from the alphabet.
   For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly
   one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.

   A composite number can be factored many different ways. For instance, not
   including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored in 7 distinct ways:

   24 = 2x2x2x3
   24 = 2x3x4
   24 = 2x2x6
   24 = 4x6
   24 = 3x8
   24 = 2x12
   24 = 24

   Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding
   together the digits of that number, and repeating that process until a
   number is arrived at that is less than 10. Thus the digital root of 467 is
   8.

   We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of the
   individual factors of our number.
   The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for 24.

   Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from
   each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the size 1
   triangle in the sketch below.

   Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or
   location can now be observed in that triangle. Using size 1 triangles as
   building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2
   triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either
   different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in
   that size 2 triangle.

   It can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle
   building blocks. A size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle
   building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n^2 size 1
   triangle building blocks.

   If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size

Problem 165
===========


   A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.
   By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three
   possibilities:
   the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in
   common.

   Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be
   the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the
   segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint
   of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.
   We will call a common point T of two segments L[1] and L[2] a true
   intersection point of L[1] and L[2] if T is the only common point of L[1]
   and L[2] and T is an interior point of both segments.

   Consider the three segments L[1], L[2], and L[3]:

   L[1]: (27, 44) to (12, 32)
   L[2]: (46, 53) to (17, 62)
   L[3]: (46, 70) to (22, 40)

   It can be verified that line segments L[2] and L[3] have a true
   intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of L[3]:
   (22,40) lies on L[1] this is not considered to be a true point of
   intersection. L[1] and L[2] have no common point. So among the three line
   segments, we find one true intersection point.

   Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate
   20000 numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number
   generator.

   s[0] = 290797

   s[n+1] = s[n]Ã—s[n] (modulo 50515093)

   t[n] = s[n] (modulo 500)

   To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers t[n]. That
   is, the first line segment is given by:

   (t[1], t[2]) to (t[3], t[4])

   The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should
   be: 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to
   (12,232).

   How many distinct true intersection points are found among the 5000 line
   segments?

   The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:

   Generate two distinct primes p and q.
   Compute n=pq and Ï†=(p-1)(q-1).
   Find an integer e, 1<e<Ï†, such that gcd(e,Ï†)=1.

   A message in this system is a number in the interval [0,n-1].
   A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in
   the interval [0,n-1]).
   To encrypt the text, for each message, m, c=m^e mod n is calculated.

   To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate d such
   that ed=1 mod Ï†, then for each encrypted message, c, calculate m=c^d mod
   n.

   There exist values of e and m such that m^e mod n=m.
   We call messages m for which m^e mod n=m unconcealed messages.

   An issue when choosing e is that there should not be too many unconcealed
   messages.
   For instance, let p=19 and q=37.
   Then n=19*37=703 and Ï†=18*36=648.
   If we choose e=181, then, although gcd(181,648)=1 it turns out that all
   possible messages
   m (0â‰¤mâ‰¤n-1) are unconcealed when calculating m^e mod n.
   For any valid choice of e there exist some unconcealed messages.
   It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.

   Choose p=1009 and q=3643.
   Find the sum of all values of e, 1<e<Ï†(1009,3643) and gcd(e,Ï†)=1, so that
   the number of unconcealed messages for this value of e is at a minimum.

   Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into k equal parts, r =
   N/k, so that N = r + r + ... + r.
   Let P be the product of these parts, P = r Ã— r Ã— ... Ã— r = r^k.

   For example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 +
   2.2 + 2.2, then P = 2.2^5 = 51.53632.

   Let M(N) = P[max] for a given value of N.

   It turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven into
   four equal parts which leads to P[max] = (11/4)^4; that is, M(11) =
   14641/256 = 57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal.

   However, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three
   equal parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal.

   Let D(N) = N if M(N) is a non-terminating decimal and D(N) = -N if M(N) is
   a terminating decimal.

   Consider the set I[r] of points (x,y) with integer co-ordinates in the
   interior of the circle with radius r, centered at the origin, i.e. x^2 +
   y^2 < r^2.

   For a radius of 2, I[2] contains the nine points (0,0), (1,0), (1,1),
   (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) and (1,-1). There are eight
   triangles having all three vertices in I[2] which contain the origin in
   the interior. Two of them are shown below, the others are obtained from
   these by rotation.

   For a radius of 3, there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the
   interior and having all vertices in I[3] and for I[5] the number is 10600.

   How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and

Problem 185
===========


   The game Number Mind is a variant of the well known game Master Mind.

   Instead of coloured pegs, you have to guess a secret sequence of digits.
   After each guess you're only told in how many places you've guessed the
   correct digit. So, if the sequence was 1234 and you guessed 2036, you'd be
   told that you have one correct digit; however, you would NOT be told that
   you also have another digit in the wrong place.

   For instance, given the following guesses for a 5-digit secret sequence,

   90342 ;2 correct
   70794 ;0 correct
   39458 ;2 correct
   34109 ;1 correct
   51545 ;2 correct
   12531 ;1 correct

   The correct sequence 39542 is unique.

   Based on the following guesses,

   5616185650518293 ;2 correct
   3847439647293047 ;1 correct
   5855462940810587 ;3 correct

   A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is a
   rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s â‰¤ d, so that any rational
   number p/q which is closer to x than r/s has q > d.

   Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for

   the two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6.We
   shall call a real number x ambiguous, if there is at least one denominator
   bound for which x possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous
   number is necessarily rational.

   How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q,0 < x < 1/100, are there whose

Problem 204
===========


   A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger
   than 5.
   So the first few Hamming numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15.
   There are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 10^8.

   We will call a positive number a generalised Hamming number of type n, if
   it has no prime factor larger than n.
   Hence the Hamming numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type 5.

   How many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are there which don't
   exceed 10^9?

   For some positive integers k, there exists an integer partition of the
   formÂ Â  4^t = 2^t + k,
   where 4^t, 2^t, and k are all positive integers and t is a real number.

   The first two such partitions are 4^1 = 2^1 + 2 and 4^1.5849625... =
   2^1.5849625... + 6.

   Partitions where t is also an integer are called perfect.
   For any m â‰¥ 1 let P(m) be the proportion of such partitions that are
   perfect with k â‰¤ m.

   An axis-aligned cuboid, specified by parameters { (x[0],y[0],z[0]),

   y[0] â‰¤ Y â‰¤ y[0]+dy and z[0] â‰¤ Z â‰¤ z[0]+dz. The volume of the cuboid is the
   product, dx Ã— dy Ã— dz. The combined volume of a collection of cuboids is
   the volume of their union and will be less than the sum of the individual
   volumes if any cuboids overlap.

   Let C[1],...,C[50000] be a collection of 50000 axis-aligned cuboids such
   that C[n] has parameters

   x[0] = S[6n-5] modulo 10000
   y[0] = S[6n-4] modulo 10000
   z[0] = S[6n-3] modulo 10000
   dx = 1 + (S[6n-2] modulo 399)
   dy = 1 + (S[6n-1] modulo 399)
   dz = 1 + (S[6n] modulo 399)

   where S[1],...,S[300000] come from the "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":

   For 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 55, S[k] = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k^3] Â  (modulo 1000000)
   For 56 â‰¤ k, S[k] = [S[k-24] + S[k-55]] Â  (modulo 1000000)

   Thus, C[1] has parameters {(7,53,183),(94,369,56)}, C[2] has parameters
   {(2383,3563,5079),(42,212,344)}, and so on.

   The combined volume of the first 100 cuboids, C[1],...,C[100], is
   723581599.

   What is the combined volume of all 50000 cuboids, C[1],...,C[50000] ?

   Let A and B be bit strings (sequences of 0's and 1's).
   If A is equal to the leftmost length(A) bits of B, then A is said to be a
   prefix of B.
   For example, 00110 is a prefix of 001101001, but not of 00111 or 100110.

   A prefix-free code of size n is a collection of n distinct bit strings
   such that no string is a prefix of any other. For example, this is a
   prefix-free code of size 6:

                          0000, 0001, 001, 01, 10, 11

   Now suppose that it costs one penny to transmit a '0' bit, but four pence
   to transmit a '1'.
   Then the total cost of the prefix-free code shown above is 35 pence, which
   happens to be the cheapest possible for the skewed pricing scheme in
   question.
   In short, we write Cost(6) = 35.

Problem 227
===========


   "The Chase" is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.

   The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite players
   having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it.
   If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if
   he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise,
   he keeps the die for the next turn.
   The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled
   and passed; that player has then lost.

   In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game
   lasts?

Problem 228
===========


   Let S[n] be the regular n-sided polygon â€“ or shape â€“ whose vertices v[k]
   (kâ€‰=â€‰1,2,â€¦,n) have coordinates:

          x[k]Â â€‰Â = â€‰ cos( ^2k-1/[n] Ã—180Â°â€‰)
          y[k]Â â€‰Â = Â  sin( ^2k-1/[n] Ã—180Â°â€‰)

   Each S[n] is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points
   on the perimeter and in the interior.

   The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of adding
   every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed
   coordinate-wise: (u,â€‰v) + (x,â€‰y) = (u+x,â€‰v+y).

   For example, the sum of S[3] and S[4] is the six-sided shape shown in pink
   below:

   Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because

   3600 = 48^2 + Â Â  Â 36^2

   3600 = 20^2 + 2Ã—40^2

   3600 = 30^2 + 3Ã—30^2

   3600 = 45^2 + 7Ã—15^2

   Similarly, we find that 88201 = 99^2 + 280^2 = 287^2 + 2Ã—54^2 = 283^2 +
   3Ã—52^2 = 197^2 + 7Ã—84^2.

   In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two
   squares.We are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of
   all of the following four types:

   n = a[1]^2 + Â  b[1]^2

   n = a[2]^2 + 2 b[2]^2

   n = a[3]^2 + 3 b[3]^2

   n = a[7]^2 + 7 b[7]^2,

   where the a[k] and b[k] are positive integers.

   There are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 10^7.
   How many such numbers are there that do not exceed 2Ã—10^9?

Problem 230
===========


   For any two strings of digits, A and B, we define F[A,B] to be the
   sequence (A,B,AB,BAB,ABBAB,...) in which each term is the concatenation of
   the previous two.

   Further, we define D[A,B](n) to be the n^th digit in the first term of
   F[A,B] that contains at least n digits.

   Example:

   Let A=1415926535, B=8979323846. We wish to find D[A,B](35), say.

   The first few terms of F[A,B] are:
   1415926535
   8979323846
   14159265358979323846
   897932384614159265358979323846
   14159265358979323846897932384614159265358979323846

   Then D[A,B](35) is the 35^th digit in the fifth term, which is 9.

   Now we use for A the first 100 digits of Ï€ behind the decimal point:

   14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510
   58209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679

   and for B the next hundred digits:

   82148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128
   48111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196 .

   For an integer n â‰¥ 4, we define the lower prime square root of n, denoted
   by lps(n), as the largest prime â‰¤ âˆšn and the upper prime square root of n,
   ups(n), as the smallest prime â‰¥ âˆšn.

   So, for example, lps(4) = 2 = ups(4), lps(1000) = 31, ups(1000) = 37.
   Let us call an integer n â‰¥ 4 semidivisible, if one of lps(n) and ups(n)
   divides n, but not both.

   The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding 15 is 30, the numbers
   are 8, 10 and 12.
   15 is not semidivisible because it is a multiple of both lps(15) = 3 and
   ups(15) = 5.
   As a further example, the sum of the 92 semidivisible numbers up to 1000
   is 34825.

   Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect
   condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - i.e. products gone bad.

   The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:

     â€¢Â The five per-product spoilage rates for each supplier are equal to the
       number of products gone bad divided by the number of products
       supplied, for each of the five products in turn.
     â€¢Â The overall spoilage rate for each supplier is equal to the total
       number of products gone bad divided by the total number of products
       provided by that supplier.

   To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product
   spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor
   (ratio of spoilage rates), m>1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall
   spoilage rate was worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of m.

   There are thirty-five m>1 for which this surprising result could have
   occurred, the smallest of which is 1476/1475.

   What's the largest possible value of m?

   Create a sequence of numbers using the "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random
   number generator:

                          s[0]   = 14025256
                          s[n+1] = s[n]^2 mod 20300713

   Concatenate these numbers â€‰s[0]s[1]s[2]â€¦ to create a string w of infinite
   length.
   Then, wâ€‰=â€‰14025256741014958470038053646â€¦

   For a positive integer k, if no substring of w exists with a sum of digits
   equal to k, p(k) is defined to be zero. If at least one substring of w
   exists with a sum of digits equal to k, we define p(k)â€‰=â€‰z, where z is the
   starting position of the earliest such substring.

   For instance:

   The substrings 1, 14, 1402, â€¦
   with respective sums of digits equal to 1, 5, 7, â€¦
   start at position 1, hence p(1)â€‰=â€‰p(5)â€‰=â€‰p(7)â€‰=â€‰â€¦â€‰=â€‰1.

   The substrings 4, 402, 4025, â€¦
   with respective sums of digits equal to 4, 6, 11, â€¦
   start at position 2, hence p(4)â€‰=â€‰p(6)â€‰=â€‰p(11)â€‰=â€‰â€¦â€‰=â€‰2.

   The substrings 02, 0252, â€¦
   with respective sums of digits equal to 2, 9, â€¦
   start at position 3, hence p(2)â€‰=â€‰p(9)â€‰=â€‰â€¦â€‰=â€‰3.

   Note that substring 025 starting at position 3, has a sum of digits equal
   to 7, but there was an earlier substring (starting at position 1) with a
   sum of digits equal to 7, so p(7)â€‰=â€‰1, not 3.

   We can verify that, for 0â€‰<â€‰kâ€‰â‰¤â€‰10^3, âˆ‘â€‰p(k) = 4742.

   Find âˆ‘â€‰p(k), for 0â€‰<â€‰kâ€‰â‰¤â€‰2Â·10^15.

   Consider the region constrained by 1 â‰¤ x and 0 â‰¤ y â‰¤ ^1/[x].

   Let S[1] be the largest square that can fit under the curve.
   Let S[2] be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on.
   Let the index of S[n] be the pair (left, below) indicating the number of
   squares to the left of S[n] and the number of squares below S[n].

   The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number.
   S[2] has one square to its left and none below, so the index of S[2] is
   (1,0).
   It can be seen that the index of S[32] is (1,1) as is the index of S[50].
   50 is the largest n for which the index of S[n] is (1,1).

   What is the largest n for which the index of S[n] is (3,3)?

   Given a set of points on a plane, we define a convex hole to be a convex
   polygon having as vertices any of the given points and not containing any
   of the given points in its interior (in addition to the vertices, other
   given points may lie on the perimeter of the polygon).

   As an example, the image below shows a set of twenty points and a few such
   convex holes. The convex hole shown as a red heptagon has an area equal to
   1049694.5 square units, which is the highest possible area for a convex
   hole on the given set of points.

   For our example, we used the first 20 points (T[2kâˆ’1],â€‰T[2k]), for
   kâ€‰=â€‰1,2,â€¦,20, produced with the pseudo-random number generator:

                     S[0]   =[Â ] 290797[Â ]
                     S[n+1] =[Â ] S[n]^2 mod 50515093

Problem 253
===========


   A small child has a â€œnumber caterpillarâ€ consisting of forty jigsaw
   pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a
   line, reveal the numbers 1 to 40 in order.

   Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the
   caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the
   pieces at random and places them in the correct order.
   As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments
   that gradually merge together.
   The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally
   increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before
   finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).

Problem 254

   Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example,
   f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.

   Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.

   Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i.
   Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is
   25.

   Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.

   Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and âˆ‘â€‰sg(i) for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ 20

Problem 255
===========


   We define the rounded-square-root of a positive integer n as the square
   root of n rounded to the nearest integer.

   The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer
   arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of n:

   Let d be the number of digits of the number n.
   If d is odd, set x[0] = 2Ã—10^(d-1)â„2.
   If d is even, set x[0] = 7Ã—10^(d-2)â„2.
   Repeat:

   until x[k+1] = x[k].

   As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of n = 4321.
   n has 4 digits, so x[0] = 7Ã—10^(4-2)â„2 = 70.
   Since x[2] = x[1], we stop here.
   So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root
   of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137â€¦).

   The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly
   low.
   For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer
   (10,000 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the
   average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).

   Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of
   iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit number
   (10^13 â‰¤ n < 10^14)?
   Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

   Note: The symbols âŒŠxâŒ‹ and âŒˆxâŒ‰ represent the floor function and ceiling

Problem 256
===========


   Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room,
   without overlap.

   Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1Ã—2, there
   are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that
   can be covered.

   For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer
   dimensions a, b and even size s = aÂ·b.
   We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and â€”
   without loss of generality â€” we add the condition a â‰¤ b.

   There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no
   points where corners of four different mats meet.
   For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4Ã—4 room:

   The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is
   not: a red "X" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.

   Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with
   tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.
   Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.

   The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7Ã—10.
   All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are:
   1Ã—70, 2Ã—35 and 5Ã—14.
   Hence, T(70) = 1.

   Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5
   tatami-free rooms of size s = 1320:
   20Ã—66, 22Ã—60, 24Ã—55, 30Ã—44 and 33Ã—40.
   In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.

   Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.

Problem 260
===========


   A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.
   At her turn, a player removes one or more stones from the piles. However,
   if she takes stones from more than one pile, she must remove the same
   number of stones from each of the selected piles.

   In other words, the player chooses some N>0 and removes:

     â€¢Â N stones from any single pile; or
     â€¢Â N stones from each of any two piles (2N total); or
     â€¢Â N stones from each of the three piles (3N total).

   The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.

   A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win.
   For example, (0,0,13), (0,11,11) and (5,5,5) are winning configurations
   because the first player can immediately remove all stones.

   A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no
   matter what the first player does.
   For example, (0,1,2) and (1,3,3) are losing configurations: any legal move
   leaves a winning configuration for the second player.

   Consider all losing configurations (x[i],y[i],z[i]) where x[i] â‰¤ y[i] â‰¤
   z[i] â‰¤ 100.
   We can verify that Î£(x[i]+y[i]+z[i]) = 173895 for these.

   Find Î£(x[i]+y[i]+z[i]) where (x[i],y[i],z[i]) ranges over the losing
   configurations
   with x[i] â‰¤ y[i] â‰¤ z[i] â‰¤ 1000.

   The following equation represents the continuous topography of a

   A mosquito intends to fly from A(200,200) to B(1400,1400), without leaving
   the area given by 0Â â‰¤Â x,Â yÂ â‰¤Â 1600.

   Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a
   point A', having elevation f. Then, while remaining at the same elevation
   f, it flies around any obstacles until it arrives at a point B' directly
   above B.

   First, determine f[min] which is the minimum constant elevation allowing
   such a trip from A to B, while remaining in the specified area.
   Then, find the length of the shortest path between A' and B', while flying

   Consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3 and 6.
   Every number from 1 up to and including 6 can be written as a sum of
   distinct divisors of 6:
   1=1, 2=2, 3=1+2, 4=1+3, 5=2+3, 6=6.
   A number n is called a practical number if every number from 1 up to and
   including n can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of n.

   A pair of consecutive prime numbers with a difference of six is called a
   sexy pair (since "sex" is the Latin word for "six"). The first sexy pair
   is (23, 29).

   We may occasionally find a triple-pair, which means three consecutive sexy
   prime pairs, such that the second member of each pair is the first member
   of the next pair.

   We shall call a number n such that :

     â€¢Â (n-9, n-3), (n-3,n+3), (n+3, n+9) form a triple-pair, and
     â€¢Â the numbers n-8, n-4, n, n+4 and n+8 are all practical,

===========


   2^N binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the N-digit
   clockwise subsequences are distinct.

   For N=3, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:

   For the first arrangement, the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order,
   are:
   000, 001, 010, 101, 011, 111, 110 and 100.

   Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating the
   binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most
   significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for N=3
   are thus represented as 23 and 29:
                               00010111â€‰[2] = 23
                               00011101â€‰[2] = 29

   Calling S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see
   that S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52.

   Find S(5).

   For each integer p > 1 coprime to 10 there is a positive divisibility
   multiplier m < p which preserves divisibility by p for the following
   function on any positive integer, n:

   f(n) = (all but the last digit of n) + (the last digit of n) * m

   That is, if m is the divisibility multiplier for p, then f(n) is divisible
   by p if and only if n is divisible by p.

   (When n is much larger than p, f(n) will be less than n and repeated
   application of f provides a multiplicative divisibility test for p.)

   For example, the divisibility multiplier for 113 is 34.

   f(76275) = 7627 + 5 * 34 = 7797 : 76275 and 7797 are both divisible by 113
   f(12345) = 1234 + 5 * 34 = 1404 : 12345 and 1404 are both not divisible by

   A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value
   a[1] in the following way:

   a[n+1] = a[n]/3 if a[n] is divisible by 3. We shall denote this as a large
   downward step, "D".

   a[n+1] = (4a[n] + 2)/3 if a[n] divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. We
   shall denote this as an upward step, "U".

   a[n+1] = (2a[n] - 1)/3 if a[n] divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. We
   shall denote this as a small downward step, "d".

   The sequence terminates when some a[n] = 1.

   Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.
   For instance if a[1]=231, then the sequence
   {a[n]}={231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1} corresponds to the steps
   "DdDddUUdDD".

   Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence
   "DdDddUUdDD....".
   For instance, if a[1]=1004064, then the sequence is
   DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.
   In fact, 1004064 is the smallest possible a[1] > 10^6 that begins with the
   sequence DdDddUUdDD.

   0.

   Note that for a given set of a[k], it may be that not all values of b are
   possible.
   For instance, if a[1] = 5 and a[2] = 7, there are no q[1] â‰¥ 0 and q[2] â‰¥ 0
   such that b could be
   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 or 23.
   In fact, 23 is the largest impossible value of b for a[1] = 5 and a[2] =
   7.
   We therefore call f(5, 7) = 23.

   Let C(x,y) be a circle passing through the points (x,â€‰y), (x,â€‰y+1),
   (x+1,â€‰y) and (x+1,â€‰y+1).

   For positive integers m and n, let E(m,n) be a configuration which
   consists of the mÂ·n circles:
   { C(x,y): 0â€‰â‰¤â€‰xâ€‰<â€‰m, 0â€‰â‰¤â€‰yâ€‰<â€‰n, x and y are integers }

   An Eulerian cycle on E(m,n) is a closed path that passes through each arc
   exactly once.
   Many such paths are possible on E(m,n), but we are only interested in
   those which are not self-crossing: A non-crossing path just touches itself
   at lattice points, but it never crosses itself.

   The image below shows E(3,3) and an example of an Eulerian non-crossing
   path.

   Let L(m,n) be the number of Eulerian non-crossing paths on E(m,n).
   For example, L(1,2)â€‰=â€‰2, L(2,2)â€‰=â€‰37 and L(3,3)â€‰=â€‰104290.

   Find L(6,10) mod 10^10.

Problem 293
===========


   An even positive integer N will be called admissible, if it is a power of
   2 or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.
   The first twelve admissible numbers are 2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48.

   If N is admissible, the smallest integer M > 1 such that N+M is prime,
   will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for N.

   For example, N=630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime
   factors are the consecutive primes 2,3,5 and 7.
   The next prime number after 631 is 641; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate number
   for 630 is M=11.
   It can also be seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for 16 is 3.

   Find the sum of all distinct pseudo-Fortunate numbers for admissible
   numbers N less than 10^9.

     â€¢Â The two circles intersect at two distinct lattice points.
     â€¢Â The interior of the convex area enclosed by both circles does not

   C[1]: (x+4)^2+(y-4)^2=1
   C[2]: (x-12)^2+(y-4)^2=65

   The circles C[0], C[1] and C[2] are drawn in the picture below.

   C[0] and C[1] form a lenticular hole, as well as C[0] and C[2].

   We call an ordered pair of positive real numbers (r[1], r[2]) a lenticular
   pair if there exist two circles with radii r[1] and r[2] that form a
   lenticular hole.We can verify that (1, 5) and (5, âˆš65) are the lenticular

Problem 297
===========


   Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
   previous two terms.
   Starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
   34, 55, 89.

   Every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of nonconsecutive
   terms of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, 100 = 3 + 8 + 89.
   Such a sum is called the Zeckendorf representation of the number.

   For any integer n>0, let z(n) be the number of terms in the Zeckendorf
   representation of n.
   Thus, z(5)â€‰=â€‰1, z(14)â€‰=â€‰2, z(100)â€‰=â€‰3 etc.

   Larry and Robin play a memory game involving of a sequence of random
   numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time.
   Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number
   is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not, the
   player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number if
   his memory is full.

   Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed
   numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which
   number to remove:
   Larry's strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the
   longest time.

   Four points with integer coordinates are selected:
   A(a,Â 0), B(b,Â 0), C(0,Â c) and D(0,Â d), with 0Â <Â aÂ <Â b and 0Â <Â cÂ <Â d.
   Point P, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line AC so that
   the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP are all similar.

   It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if a=c.

   So, given that a=c, we are looking for triplets (a,b,d) such that at least
   one point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the three
   triangles ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.

   For example, if (a,b,d)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point
   P(1,1) satisfies the above condition. Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and
   (2,4,3) are considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for
   both.

   If b+dÂ <Â 100, there are 92 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P
   exists.
   If b+dÂ <Â 100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that
   point P exists.

   If b+dÂ <Â 100 000 000, how many distinct triplets (a,b,d) are there such
   that point P exists?

Problem 300
===========


   In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting
   of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH.
   For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is
   considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2^n distinct proteins
   consisting of n elements.

   When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in
   such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible,
   since this is energetically advantageous.
   As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the
   P-elements on the outside.
   Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will
   only consider protein folding in two dimensions.

   The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be
   folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).

   The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would
   never occur naturally.
   On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points,
   which is optimal for this string.

   Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position
   along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal
   folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be
   850Â /Â 2^8=3.3203125.

   What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of
   a random protein string of length 15?
   Give your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact

Problem 301
===========


   Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in
   turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.

   We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as
   follows:
   - At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.
   - On his turn the player removes any positive number of stones from any
   single heap.
   - The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.

   If (n[1],n[2],n[3]) indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size
   n[1], n[2] and n[3] then there is a simple function X(n[1],n[2],n[3]) â€”
   that you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself â€” that returns:

     â€¢Â zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will
       eventually lose; or
     â€¢Â non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will
       eventually win.

   For example X(1,2,3) = 0 because, no matter what the current player does,
   his opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size,
   at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by his
   opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To
   illustrate:
   - current player moves to (1,2,1)
   - opponent moves to (1,0,1)
   - current player moves to (0,0,1)
   - opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.

   For how many positive integers nâ€‰â‰¤â€‰2^30 does X(n,2n,3n) = 0 ?

   We shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both S and
   Ï†(S) are Achilles numbers.^1
   For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: Ï†(864) = 288 = 2^5Â·3^2.

   The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:

   Two players start with a strip of n white squares and they take alternate
   turns.
   On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them
   black.
   The first player who cannot make a move loses.

     â€¢Â If n = 1, there are no valid moves, so the first player loses
       automatically.
     â€¢Â If n = 2, there is only one valid move, after which the second player
       loses.
     â€¢Â If n = 3, there are two valid moves, but both leave a situation where
       the second player loses.
     â€¢Â If n = 4, there are three valid moves for the first player; she can
       win the game by painting the two middle squares.
     â€¢Â If n = 5, there are four valid moves for the first player (shown below
       in red); but no matter what she does, the second player (blue) wins.

   So, for 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 5, there are 3 values of n for which the first player can

   A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list
   of fractions.

   The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer,
   which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran
   program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list
   which will leave it an integer.

   For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote
   for prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:

   17 , 78 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 77 , 95 , 77 , 1  , 11 , 13 , 15 , 1 , 55 .
   91   85   51   38   33   29   23   19   17   13   11   2    7   1

   Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program
   produce the sequence:
   15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, 4, 30, ..., 136, 8, 60, ..., 544,
   32, 240, ...

   The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 2^2, 2^3, 2^5, ...
   It can be shown that all the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime
   exponents and that all the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2, in
   proper order!

   If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem
   7 (find the 10001^st prime), how many iterations would be needed until the
   program produces 2^10001st prime ?

   For example, if x = 70, y = 119 and h = 30, we can calculate that w = 56.

   In fact, for integer values x, y, h and 0 < x < y < 200, there are only

   - A SierpiÅ„ski graph of order-1 (S[1]) is an equilateral triangle.
   - S[n+1] is obtained from S[n] by positioning three copies of S[n] so that
   every pair of copies has one common corner.

   Let C(n) be the number of cycles that pass exactly once through all the
   vertices of S[n].
   For example, C(3) = 8 because eight such cycles can be drawn on S[3], as
   shown below:

   It can also be verified that :
   C(1) = C(2) = 1
   C(5) = 71328803586048
   C(10 000) mod 10^8 = 37652224
   C(10 000) mod 13^8 = 617720485

   Find C(C(C(10 000))) mod 13^8.

Problem 313
===========


   In a sliding game a counter may slide horizontally or vertically into an
   empty space. The objective of the game is to move the red counter from the
   top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner; the space always
   starts in the bottom right corner. For example, the following sequence of
   pictures show how the game can be completed in five moves on a 2 by 2
   grid.

   Let S(m,n) represent the minimum number of moves to complete the game on
   an m by n grid. For example, it can be verified that S(5,4) = 25.

   There are exactly 5482 grids for which S(m,n) = p^2, where p < 100 is
   prime.

   How many grids does S(m,n) = p^2, where p < 10^6 is prime?

Problem 314
===========


   The moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but there
   is a catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out,
   and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been
   allotted a 500 m by 500 m square area, but they will possess only that
   area which they wall in. 251001 posts have been placed in a rectangular
   grid with 1 meter spacing. The wall must be a closed series of straight
   lines, each line running from post to post.

   The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the
   entire 250 000 m^2 area. The [1]Duchy of Grand Fenwick, has a tighter
   budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape
   would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.

   You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.For a 2000
   meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m^2 area theenclosed-area/wall-length
   ratio is 125.
   Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better: if
   you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area
   will be equal to Ï€*250^2 m^2 and the perimeter will be Ï€*500 m, so the
   enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.

   However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75
   m and 75âˆš2 m the total area becomes 238750 m^2 and the perimeter becomes
   1400+300âˆš2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87,
   which is significantly better.

   Find the maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.
   Give your answer rounded to 8 places behind the decimal point in the form
   abc.defghijk.

Problem 315
===========


   Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two "digital
   root" clocks.
   A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step
   by step.

   When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the
   calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the
   result.
   For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: "137" â†’
   "11" â†’ "2" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.

   Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal
   (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left,
   bottom-right).
   Number "1" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number "4" is
   made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and
   bottom-right. Number "8" lights them all.

   The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
   To turn on a "2" will cost 5 transitions, while a "7" will cost only 4
   transitions.

   Sam and Max built two different clocks.

   Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows "137", then the panel
   is turned off, then the next number ("11") is turned on, then the panel is
   turned off again and finally the last number ("2") is turned on and, after
   some time, off.
   For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:

   "137" : (2 + 5 + 4) Ã— 2 = 22 transitions ("137" on/off).
   "11"  : (2 + 2) Ã— 2 = 8 transitions ("11" on/off).
   "2"   : (5) Ã— 2 = 10 transitions ("2" on/off).

   For a grand total of 40 transitions.

   Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it
   is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for
   the next number.
   For number 137, Max's clock requires:

           2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions ("137" on)
   "137" : 7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for
           number "11").
           0 transitions (number "11" is already turned on correctly)
   "11"  : 3 transitions (to turn off the first "1" and the bottom part of
           the second "1";
           the top part is common with number "2").
           4 tansitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a
   "2"   : "2")
           5 transitions (to turn off number "2").

   For a grand total of 30 transitions.

   Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.
   The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10^7 and B =
   2Ã—10^7.
   Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by
   Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.

   Let p = p[1] p[2] p[3] ... be an infinite sequence of random digits,
   selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.
   It can be seen that p corresponds to the real number 0.p[1] p[2] p[3] ....
   It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval
   [0,1) is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits
   selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.

   For any positive integer n with d decimal digits, let k be the smallest
   index such that
   p[k, ]p[k+1], ...p[k+d-1] are the decimal digits of n, in the same order.
   Also, let g(n) be the expected value of k; it can be proven that g(n) is
   always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.

   For example, if n = 535, then
   for p = 31415926535897...., we get k = 9
   for p = 355287143650049560000490848764084685354..., we get k = 36

   Consider the real number âˆš2+âˆš3.
   When we calculate the even powers of âˆš2+âˆš3we get:
   (âˆš2+âˆš3)^2 = 9.898979485566356...
   (âˆš2+âˆš3)^4 = 97.98979485566356...

   A horizontal row comprising of 2n + 1 squares has n red counters placed at
   one end and n blue counters at the other end, being separated by a single
   empty square in the centre. For example, when n = 3.

   A counter can move from one square to the next (slide) or can jump over
   another counter (hop) as long as the square next to that counter is
   unoccupied.

   Let M(n) represent the minimum number of moves/actions to completely
   reverse the positions of the coloured counters; that is, move all the red
   counters to the right and all the blue counters to the left.

Problem 325
===========


   A game is played with two piles of stones and two players. At her turn, a
   player removes a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of
   stones she removes must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in
   the smaller pile.

   E.g., let the ordered pair(6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in
   the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player
   can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.

   The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.

   A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win. For
   example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the
   first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.

   A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no
   matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing
   configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the
   second player.

   Define S(N) as the sum of (x[i]+y[i]) for all losing configurations
   (x[i],y[i]), 0 < x[i] < y[i] â‰¤ N. We can verify that S(10) = 211 and
   S(10^4) = 230312207313.

Problem 327
===========


   A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.

   Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door
   automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A
   machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each
   room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect
   that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an
   unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become
   permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may safely
   store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.

   If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you
   entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in
   that room forever!

   However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible.
   For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card
   in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the
   start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine
   you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the
   box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will be able to
   travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you to travel
   through all three rooms using six security cards in total.

   It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of 123 security
   cards while carrying a maximum of 3 cards.

   Let C be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any time.

   Let R be the number of rooms to travel through.

   Let M(C,R) be the minimum number of cards required from the dispensing
   machine to travel through R rooms carrying up to a maximum of C cards at
   any time.

   For example, M(3,6)=123 and M(4,6)=23.
   And, Î£M(C,6)=146 for 3 â‰¤ C â‰¤ 4.

   You are given that Î£M(C,10)=10382 for 3 â‰¤ C â‰¤ 10.

Problem 328
===========


   We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
   {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, has a
   cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers:

     â€¢Â "Your guess is lower than the hidden number", or
     â€¢Â "Yes, that's it!", or
     â€¢Â "Your guess is higher than the hidden number".

   Given the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e.
   the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.

   If n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "2". The answer
   will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).

   If n=8, we might decide to use a "binary search" type of strategy: Our
   first question would be "4" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we
   will need one or two additional questions.
   Let our second question be "6". If the hidden number is still higher than
   6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.
   Thus, our third question will be "7" and the total cost for this
   worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.

   We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking "5" as
   our first question.
   If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second
   question will be "7", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number
   is (for a total cost of 5+7=12).
   If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question
   will be "3" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question
   will be "1", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.
   Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better
   than what we achieved previously with the "binary search" strategy; it is
   also better than or equal to any other strategy.
   So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.

   Let C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as
   described above.
   Thus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.
   Similarly, C(100) = 400 and C(n) = 17575.

   Find C(n).

Problem 331
===========


   NÃ—N disks are placed on a square game board. Each disk has a black side
   and white side.

   At each turn, you may choose a disk and flip all the disks in the same row
   and the same column as this disk: thus 2Ã—N-1 disks are flipped. The game
   ends when all disks show their white side. The following example shows a
   game on a 5Ã—5 board.

   It can be proven that 3 is the minimal number of turns to finish this
   game.

   The bottom left disk on the NÃ—N board has coordinates (0,0);
   the bottom right disk has coordinates (N-1,0) and the top left disk has
   coordinates (0,N-1).

   Let C[N] be the following configuration of a board with NÃ—N disks:
   A disk at (x,y) satisfying , shows its black side; otherwise, it shows its
   white side. C[5] is shown above.

   Let T(N) be the minimal number of turns to finish a game starting from
   configuration C[N] or 0 if configuration C[N] is unsolvable.
   We have shown that T(5)=3. You are also given that T(10)=29 and T(1
   000)=395253.

Problem 333
===========


   All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and every
   term of the partition can be expressed as 2^ix3^j, where i,j â‰¥ 0.

   Let's consider only those such partitions where none of the terms can
   divide any of the other terms.
   For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (2^1x3^0 + 2^1x3^1 +
   2^0x3^2) would not be valid since 2 can divide 6. Neither would the
   partition 17 = 16 + 1 = (2^4x3^0 + 2^0x3^0) since 1 can divide 16. The
   only valid partition of 17 would be 8 + 9 = (2^3x3^0 + 2^0x3^2).

   Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11
   having the following two partitions.
   11 = 2 + 9 = (2^1x3^0 + 2^0x3^2)
   11 = 8 + 3 = (2^3x3^0 + 2^0x3^1)

   Let's define P(n) as the number of valid partitions of n. For example,
   P(11) = 2.

   Let's consider only the prime integers q which would have a single valid
   partition such as P(17).

   The sum of the primes q <100 such that P(q)=1 equals 233.

   Find the sum of the primes q <1000000 such that P(q)=1.

Problem 334
===========


   In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight
   line.
   Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.
   A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two
   beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.
   The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.

   For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans
   respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will
   finish the game:

   You are given the following sequences:

   t[0] = 123456.

            t[i-1] ,         if t[i-1] is even
   t[i] =   2
            t[i-1]   926252, if t[i-1] is odd
            2
           where âŒŠxâŒ‹ is the floor function
           and is the bitwise XOR operator.

   b[i] = ( t[i] mod 2^11) + 1.

   The first two terms of the last sequence are b[1] = 289 and b[2] = 145.
   If we start with b[1] and b[2] beans in two adjacent bowls, 3419100 moves
   would be required to finish the game.

   Consider now 1500 adjacent bowls containing b[1], b[2],..., b[1500] beans
   respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes
   before the game ends.

   Whenever Peter feels bored, he places some bowls, containing one bean
   each, in a circle. After this, he takes all the beans out of a certain

   this, starting from the bowl he dropped the last bean in, until the
   initial situation appears again. For example with 5 bowls he acts as
   follows:

   So with 5 bowls it takes Peter 15 moves to return to the initial
   situation.

   Let M(x) represent the number of moves required to return to the initial

Problem 336
===========


   A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However,
   sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in
   the correct order.
   To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating
   turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train
   moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The
   remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then
   rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to
   obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.
   Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are
   separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has
   been achieved.

   However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency,
   so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the
   correct place, then carriage B, and so on.

   Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we
   shall call maximix arrangements, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him
   five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be
   solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown
   below.

   It can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six
   carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is DFAECB.

   Find the 2011^th lexicographic maximix arrangement for eleven carriages.

   One variant of N.G. de Bruijn's silver dollar game can be described as
   follows:

   On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per
   square. Only one coin, called the silver dollar, has any value. Two
   players take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either a
   regular or a special move.

   A regular move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more
   squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on or
   over another coin.

   Alternatively, the player can choose to make the special move of pocketing
   the leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no regular moves
   are possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost coin.

   The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.

   A winning configuration is an arrangement of coins on the strip where the
   first player can force a win no matter what the second player does.

   Let W(n,c) be the number of winning configurations for a strip of n
   squares, c worthless coins and one silver dollar.

   Examples: gcd(2,6,4) = 2, gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1 and gcd(11) = 11.

   The least common multiple, or lcm, of a list is the smallest natural
   number divisible by each entry of the list.
   Examples: lcm(2,6,4) = 12, lcm(10,6,15,6) = 30 and lcm(11) = 11.

   Let f(G, L, N) be the number of lists of size N with gcd â‰¥ G and lcm â‰¤ L.
   For example:

   f(10, 100, 1) = 91.
   f(10, 100, 2) = 327.
   f(10, 100, 3) = 1135.
   f(10, 100, 1000) mod 101^4 = 3286053.

   Find f(10^6, 10^12, 10^18) mod 101^4.

   A hexagonal orchard of order n is a triangular lattice made up of points
   within a regular hexagon with side n. The following is an example of a
   hexagonal orchard of order 5:

   Highlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by a
   point closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order
   5, 30 points are hidden from the center.

   Let H(n) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal
   orchard of order n.

   H(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.

   Find H(100 000 000).

Problem 352
===========


   Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known
   to affect 2% of the sheep population.An accurate and extremely sensitive
   PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative
   result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.

   Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of
   performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:

   The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. For each
   group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed.
   Then,

     â€¢Â If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to
       be virus-free.
     â€¢Â If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a
       separate test for each animal) to determine the affected
       individual(s).

   Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02,
   the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:

     â€¢Â Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.98^5 =
       0.9039207968.
     â€¢Â Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968
       = 0.0960792032.

   Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 Ã— 5
   = 1.480396016.
   Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only
   1.480396016 Ã— 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more
   than 70% !

   Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it
   can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is
   sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by
   mixing different samples). E.g.:

     â€¢Â We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It
       can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be
       negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only
       be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.
     â€¢Â If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and
       the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to
       run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).
     â€¢Â We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals
       in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total
       expected number of tests will be minimised.

   To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction
   we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we
   start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must
   be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached
   for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.

   For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing
   scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just
   4.155452 tests!

   Using the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of
   tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p
   to be present in any individual.
   Thus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25,
   0.10) = 12.702124.

   Find Î£T(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.
   Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.

   A moon could be described by the sphere C(r) with centre (0,0,0) and
   radius r.

   There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of C(r) with
   integer coordinates. The station at (0,0,r) is called North Pole station,
   the station at (0,0,-r) is called South Pole station.

   All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on the
   great arc through the stations. A journey between two stations is risky.
   If d is the length of the road between two stations, (d/(Ï€ r))^2 is a
   measure for the risk of the journey (let us call it the risk of the road).
   If the journey includes more than two stations, the risk of the journey is
   the sum of risks of the used roads.

   A direct journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station has
   the length Ï€r and risk 1. The journey from the North Pole station to the
   South Pole station via (0,r,0) has the same length, but a smaller risk:
   (Â½Ï€r/(Ï€r))^2+(Â½Ï€r/(Ï€r))^2=0.5.

   The minimal risk of a journey from the North Pole station to the South
   Pole station on C(r) is M(r).

   An infinite number of people (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.) are lined up to get
   a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite
   number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor contains an
   infinite number of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.).

   Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the n^th
   person is assigned a room: person n gets the first vacant room in the
   lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:

     â€¢Â the floor is empty
     â€¢Â the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that
       floor is person m, then m + n is a perfect square

   Person 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.
   Person 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect
   square.
   Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.
   Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.

   Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.

   Define P(f, r) to be n if person n occupies room r in floor f, and 0 if no
   person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:
   P(1, 1) = 1
   P(1, 2) = 3
   P(2, 1) = 2

   The first several terms of {T[n]} are given as follows:

   We define {A[n]} as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary
   expression of each element appears as a subsequence in {T[n]}.
   For example, the decimal number 18 is expressed as 10010 in binary. 10010
   appears in {T[n]} (T[8] to T[12]), so 18 is an element of {A[n]}.
   The decimal number 14 is expressed as 1110 in binary. 1110 never appears
   in {T[n]}, so 14 is not an element of {A[n]}.

   Q[2] are drawn such that
   P[0]Q[0]/P[0]P[1]=P[1]Q[1]/P[1]P[2]=P[2]Q[2]/P[2]P[3]=t (t in [0,1]).

   such thatQ[0]R[0]/Q[0]Q[1]=Q[1]R[1]/Q[1]Q[2]=t for the same value of t.
   On the segment R[0]R[1] the point B is drawn such that R[0]B/R[0]R[1]=t
   for the same value of t.The BÃ©zier curve defined by the points P[0], P[1],
   P[2], P[3] is the locus of B as Q[0] takes all possible positions on the
   segment P[0]P[1]. (Please note that for all points the value of t is the

   In the applet to the right you can drag the points P[0], P[1], P[2] and
   P[3] to see what the BÃ©zier curve (green curve) defined by those points
   looks like. You can also drag the point Q[0] along the segment P[0]P[1].

   An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of
   positive integers.

   Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered
   the same.A partition of n into distinct parts is a partition of n in which
   every part occurs at most once.

   The partitions of 5 into distinct parts are:
   5, 4+1 and 3+2.

   Let f(n) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of n
   into distinct parts and let m(n) be the number of elements of any such
   partition of n with that product.

   So f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.

   For n=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives
   f(10)=30 and m(10)=3.
   And their product, f(10)Â·m(10) = 30Â·3 = 90

   It can be verified that
   âˆ‘f(n)Â·m(n) for 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 = 1683550844462.

   Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:

   Die A: 1 4 4 4 4 4
   Die B: 2 2 2 5 5 5
   Die C: 3 3 3 3 3 6

   A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The
   player who rolls the highest value wins.

   If the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get
   P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2

   If the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get
   P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2

   If the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get
   P(second player wins) = 25/36 > 1/2

   So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another
   die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning.
   A set of dice having this property is called a nontransitive set of dice.

   We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will
   assume the following conditions:

     â€¢Â There are three six-sided dice with each side having between 1 and N
       pips, inclusive.
     â€¢Â Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on
       the die the pips are located.
     â€¢Â The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll
       the same value neither player wins.
     â€¢Â The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.

   For N = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets.
   How many are there for N = 30 ?

   A polygon is a flat shape consisting of straight line segments that are

     â€¢Â no two sides of P are the same length,
     â€¢Â the length of every side of P is in S, and
     â€¢Â S contains no other value.

   For example:
   The set {3, 4, 5} generates a polygon with sides 3, 4, and 5 (a triangle).
   The set {6, 9, 11, 24} generates a polygon with sides 6, 9, 11, and 24 (a
   quadrilateral).
   The sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4, 9} do not generate any polygon at all.

   Let s[k] be the number of 1â€™s when writing the numbers from 0 to k in
   binary.
   For example, writing 0 to 5 in binary, we have 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101.
   There are seven 1â€™s, so s[5] = 7.
   The sequence S = {s[k] : k â‰¥ 0} starts {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, ...}.

   A game is played by two players. Before the game starts, a number n is
   chosen. A counter c starts at 0. At each turn, the player chooses a number
   from 1 to n (inclusive) and increases c by that number. The resulting
   value of c must be a member of S. If there are no more valid moves, the
   player loses.

   For example:
   Let n = 5. c starts at 0.
   Player 1 chooses 4, so c becomes 0 + 4 = 4.
   Player 2 chooses 5, so c becomes 4 + 5 = 9.
   Player 1 chooses 3, so c becomes 9 + 3 = 12.
   etc.
   Note that c must always belong to S, and each player can increase c by at
   most n.

   Let M(n) be the highest number the first player can choose at her first
   turn to force a win, and M(n) = 0 if there is no such move. For example,
   M(2) = 2, M(7) = 1 and M(20) = 4.

   - He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is
   remaining of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally
   likely. This will divide the remaining pie into three pieces.
   - Going counterclockwise from the initial cut, he takes the first two pie

Problem 395
===========


   The Pythagorean tree is a fractal generated by the following procedure:

   Start with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in the
   animation, the bottom side is the base):

   Â 1.Â Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the base, with the
       hypotenuse coinciding with that side and with the sides in a 3-4-5
       ratio. Note that the smaller side of the triangle must be on the
       'right' side with respect to the base (see animation).
   Â 2.Â Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with one of its
       sides coinciding with that leg.
   Â 3.Â Repeat this procedure for both squares, considering as their bases the
       sides touching the triangle.

   The resulting figure, after an infinite number of iterations, is the
   Pythagorean tree.

   It can be shown that there exists at least one rectangle, whose sides are
   parallel to the largest square of the Pythagorean tree, which encloses the
   Pythagorean tree completely.

   Find the smallest area possible for such a bounding rectangle, and give
   your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

Problem 396
===========


   For any positive integer n, the nth weak Goodstein sequence {g[1], g[2],
   g[3], ...} is defined as:

     â€¢Â g[1] = n
     â€¢Â for k > 1, g[k] is obtained by writing g[k-1] in base k, interpreting
       it as a base k + 1 number, and subtracting 1.

   The sequence terminates when g[k] becomes 0.

   For example, the 6th weak Goodstein sequence is {6, 11, 17, 25, ...}:

     â€¢Â g[1] = 6.
     â€¢Â g[2] = 11 since 6 = 110[2], 110[3] = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11.
     â€¢Â g[3] = 17 since 11 = 102[3], 102[4] = 18, and 18 - 1 = 17.
     â€¢Â g[4] = 25 since 17 = 101[4], 101[5] = 26, and 26 - 1 = 25.

   and so on.

   It can be shown that every weak Goodstein sequence terminates.

   Let G(n) be the number of nonzero elements in the nth weak Goodstein
   sequence.
   It can be verified that G(2) = 3, G(4) = 21 and G(6) = 381.

   The first 15 fibonacci numbers are:
   1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610.
   It can be seen that 8 and 144 are not squarefree: 8 is divisible by 4 and
   144 is divisible by 4 and by 9.
   So the first 13 squarefree fibonacci numbers are:
   1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377 and 610.

   The 200th squarefree fibonacci number
   is:971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445.
   The last sixteen digits of this number are: 1608739584170445 and in
   scientific notation this number can be written as 9.7e53.

   Find the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number.
   Give as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by a comma followed
   by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after the
   decimal point).
   For the 200th squarefree number the answer would have been:
   1608739584170445,9.7e53

   Note:
   For this problem, assume that for every prime p, the first fibonacci
   number divisible by p is not divisible by p^2 (this is part of Wall's
   conjecture). This has been verified for primes â‰¤ 3Â·10^15, but has not been
   proven in general.
   If it happens that the conjecture is false, then the accepted answer to
   this problem isn't guaranteed to be the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci

Problem 406
===========


   We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
   {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, we get
   one of three possible answers:

     â€¢Â "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of
       a), or
     â€¢Â "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of
       b), or
     â€¢Â "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).

   Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total
   cost for the worst possible case.

   For example, if n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3, then we may begin by asking "2"
   as our first question.

   If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
   b=3), then we are sure that "1" is the hidden number (for a total cost of
   3).
   If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2),
   then our next question will be "4".
   If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
   b=3), then we are sure that "3" is the hidden number (for a total cost of
   2+3=5).
   If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2),
   then we are sure that "5" is the hidden number (for a total cost of
   2+2=4).
   Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be
   shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. So, in
   fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of
   n, a, and b.

   Let C(n, a, b) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for
   the given values of n, a, and b.

   Here are a few examples:
   C(5, 2, 3) = 5

Problem 414
===========


   6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and
   subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in
   decreasing order, we get 7641-1467=6174.
   Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and
   repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up
   with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal.
   This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the
   number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.
   E.g. let's start with the number 0837:
   8730-0378=8352
   8532-2358=6174

   6174 is called the Kaprekar constant. The process of sorting and
   subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is
   reached is called the Kaprekar routine.

   We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.
   Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all
   cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or
   the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input
   numbers.
   However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3â‰ 9, a
   Kaprekar constant exists.
   E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)[15]
   base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)[21]

   Define C[b] to be the Kaprekar constant in base b for 5 digits.Define the
   function sb(i) to be

     â€¢Â 0 if i = C[b] or if i written in base b consists of 5 identical digits
     â€¢Â the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base b to
       arrive at C[b], otherwise

   Note that we can define sb(i) for all integers i < b^5. If i written in
   base b takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero
   digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.

   Define S(b) as the sum of sb(i) for 0 < i < b^5.
   E.g. S(15) = 5274369
   S(111) = 400668930299

   Find the sum of S(6k+3) for 2 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 300.

   A row of n squares contains a frog in the leftmost square. By successive
   jumps the frog goes to the rightmost square and then back to the leftmost
   square. On the outward trip he jumps one, two or three squares to the
   right, and on the homeward trip he jumps to the left in a similar manner.
   He cannot jump outside the squares. He repeats the round-trip travel m
   times.

   Let F(m, n) be the number of the ways the frog can travel so that at most
   one square remains unvisited.
   For example, F(1, 3) = 4, F(1, 4) = 15, F(1, 5) = 46, F(2, 3) = 16 and
   F(2, 100) mod 10^9 = 429619151.

   Find the last 9 digits of F(10, 10^12).

Problem 417
===========


   A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of
   the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

     1/2  =Â  0.5
     1/3  =Â  0.(3)
     1/4  =Â  0.25
     1/5  =Â  0.2
     1/6  =Â  0.1(6)
     1/7  =Â  0.(142857)
     1/8  =Â  0.125
     1/9  =Â  0.(1)
     1/10 =Â  0.1

   Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can
   be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

   Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or
   5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.
   We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0.

   Let L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n.You are given
   that âˆ‘L(n) for 3 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1 000 000 equals 55535191115.

   Find âˆ‘L(n) for 3 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 000 000

   The look and say sequence goes 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221,
   1113213211, ...
   The sequence starts with 1 and all other members are obtained by
   describing the previous member in terms of consecutive digits.
   It helps to do this out loud:
   1 is 'one one' â†’ 11
   11 is 'two ones' â†’ 21
   21 is 'one two and one one' â†’ 1211
   1211 is 'one one, one two and two ones' â†’ 111221
   111221 is 'three ones, two twos and one one' â†’ 312211
   ...

   Define A(n), B(n) and C(n) as the number of ones, twos and threes in the
   n'th element of the sequence respectively.
   One can verify that A(40) = 31254, B(40) = 20259 and C(40) = 11625.

   Find A(n), B(n) and C(n) for n = 10^12.
   Give your answer modulo 2^30 and separate your values for A, B and C by a

   Numbers of the form n^15+1 are composite for every integer n > 1.
   For positive integers n and m let s(n,m) be defined as the sum of the
   distinct prime factors of n^15+1 not exceeding m.

   E.g. 2^15+1 = 3Ã—3Ã—11Ã—331.
   So s(2,10) = 3 and s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345.

   Also 10^15+1 = 7Ã—11Ã—13Ã—211Ã—241Ã—2161Ã—9091.
   So s(10,100) = 31 and s(10,1000) = 483.

   Let H be the hyperbola defined by the equation 12x^2 + 7xy - 12y^2 = 625.

   Next, define X as the point (7, 1). It can be seen that X is in H.

   Now we define a sequence of points in H, {P[i] : i â‰¥ 1}, as:

     â€¢Â P[1] = (13, 61/4).
     â€¢Â P[2] = (-43/6, -4).
     â€¢Â For i > 2, P[i] is the unique point in H that is different from P[i-1]

       shown that P[i] is well-defined, and that its coordinates are always
       rational.

   You are given that P[3] = (-19/2, -229/24), P[4] = (1267/144, -37/12) and

Problem 423
===========


   Let n be a positive integer.
   A 6-sided die is thrown n times. Let c be the number of pairs of
   consecutive throws that give the same value.

   For example, if n = 7 and the values of the die throws are
   (1,1,5,6,6,6,3), then the following pairs of consecutive throws give the
   same value:
   (1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
   (1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
   (1,1,5,6,6,6,3)
   Therefore, c = 3 for (1,1,5,6,6,6,3).

   Define C(n) as the number of outcomes of throwing a 6-sided die n times

Problem 424
===========


   The above is an example of a cryptic kakuro (also known as cross sums, or
   even sums cross) puzzle, with its final solution on the right. (The common
   rules of kakuro puzzles can be found easily on numerous internet sites.
   Other related information can also be currently found at [1]krazydad.com
   whose author has provided the puzzle data for this challenge.)

   The downloadable text file ([2]kakuro200.txt) contains the description of
   200 such puzzles, a mix of 5x5 and 6x6 types. The first puzzle in the file
   is the above example which is coded as follows:

   6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X

   The first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the
   information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7
   (for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left
   column are needed to insert information.

   The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going
   left to right and starting with the top line.
   X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.
   O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.
   A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its
   equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.
   ( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a
   lower case "h" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case "v". Those
   are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a
   single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter
   would be for the "tens" and the second one for the "units". When the cell
   must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the
   first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a
   comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets
   is also immediately followed by a comma.

   The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line
   Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.

   The required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter
   necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical
   order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be
   8426039571. At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part of
   the problem description. When only 9 are given, the missing one must be
   assigned the remaining digit.

   You are given that the sum of the answers for the first 10 puzzles in the
   file is 64414157580.

   Find the sum of the answers for the 200 puzzles.

Problem 425
===========


   Two positive numbers A and B are said to be connected (denoted by "A â†” B")
   if one of these conditions holds:
   (1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for
   example, 123 â†” 173.
   (2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example,
   23 â†” 223 and 123 â†” 23.

   We call a prime P a 2's relative if there exists a chain of connected
   primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.

   For example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is shown
   below:
   2 â†” 3 â†” 13 â†” 113 â†” 103 â†” 107 â†” 127
   However, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.

   Let F(N) be the sum of the primes â‰¤ N which are not 2's relatives.
   We can verify that F(10^3) = 431 and F(10^4) = 78728.

   Find F(10^7).

Problem 426
===========


   Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For
   example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed
   by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can
   be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of
   consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.

   A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the
   following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the
   nearest empty box to its right.

   After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can
   be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first
   occupied box.

   A system like this is called a Box-Ball System or BBS for short.

   It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system
   evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is
   invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes
   evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.

   We define the sequence {t[i]}:

     â€¢Â s[0] = 290797
     â€¢Â s[k+1] = s[k]^2 mod 50515093
     â€¢Â t[k] = (s[k] mod 64) + 1

   Starting from the initial configuration (t[0], t[1], â€¦, t[10]), the final
   state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].
   Starting from the initial configuration (t[0], t[1], â€¦, t[10 000 000]),
   find the final state.
   Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final
   state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 1^2 + 2^2
   + 3^2) is your answer.

   A sequence of integers S = {s[i]} is called an n-sequence if it has n
   elements and each element s[i] satisfies 1 â‰¤ s[i] â‰¤ n. Thus there are n^n

   7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7} is a 10-sequence.

   For any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous
   subsequence of S with the same value.For example, for the given sequence S
   above, L(S) = 3, because of the three consecutive 7's.

   Let f(n) = âˆ‘ L(S) for all n-sequences S.

Problem 431
===========


   Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm
   and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated
   when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from
   the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture
   cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base.
   Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.

   Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered
   from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the
   horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of
   repose, $\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the
   silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the
   case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted
   would be approximately 32.648388556 m^3. However, if grain is delivered at
   a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the
   centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He
   shows Fred a picture.

   We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by
   $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal
   places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \approx 36$.
   Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one
   other option: $V(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It would be like knowing that
   the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your
   grain.

   Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on
   closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness
   turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the
   radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of
   repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of
   solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep
   it.

   If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the
   farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$
   for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\sum x$
   correct to 9 decimal places.

Problem 434
===========


   Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the
   vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.
   Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with
   a point in the Euclidean space.
   A flexible graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move
   one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least
   two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair
   of adjacent vertices is kept constant.
   A rigid graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.
   Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully
   rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic,
   no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the
   graph.

   The grid graphs embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the
   following animation demonstrates:

   However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells.
   For example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph
   rigid:

   Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing
   the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell
   as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.

   Let R(m,n) be the number of ways to make the m Ã— n grid graph rigid.
   E.g. R(2,3) = 19 and R(5,5) = 23679901

   Define S(N) as âˆ‘R(i,j) for 1 â‰¤ i, j â‰¤ N.

   The Fibonacci numbers {f[n], n â‰¥ 0} are defined recursively as f[n] =
   f[n-1] + f[n-2] with base cases f[0] = 0 and f[1] = 1.

   Define the polynomials {F[n], n â‰¥ 0} as F[n](x) = âˆ‘f[i]x^i for 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n.

   For example, F[7](x) = x + x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^4 + 5x^5 + 8x^6 + 13x^7, and
   F[7](11) = 268357683.

   Let n = 10^15. Find the sum [âˆ‘[0â‰¤xâ‰¤100] F[n](x)] mod 1307674368000 (=

   Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise.
   She suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash the
   dishes.
   For this game, they shall use a generator of independent random numbers
   uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
   The game starts with S = 0.
   The first player, Louise, adds to S different random numbers from the
   generator until S > 1 and records her last random number 'x'.
   The second player, Julie, continues adding to S different random numbers
   from the generator until S > 2 and records her last random number 'y'.
   The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the dishes,
   i.e. if y > x the second player wins.

   For example, if the first player draws 0.62 and 0.44, the first player
   turn ends since 0.62+0.44 > 1 and x = 0.44.
   If the second players draws 0.1, 0.27 and 0.91, the second player turn
   ends since 0.62+0.44+0.1+0.27+0.91 > 2 and y = 0.91.Since y > x, the
   second player wins.

   Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: "That's not fair".
   What is the probability that the second player wins?

Problem 437
===========


   When we calculate 8^n modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3,
   2, 5, 7.
   As we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a primitive root
   of 11.
   But there is more:
   If we take a closer look we see:
   1+8=9
   8+9=17â‰¡6 mod 11
   9+6=15â‰¡4 mod 11
   6+4=10
   4+10=14â‰¡3 mod 11
   10+3=13â‰¡2 mod 11
   3+2=5
   2+5=7
   5+7=12â‰¡1 mod 11.

   So the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8^n + 8^n+1 â‰¡
   8^n+2 (mod 11).
   8 is called a Fibonacci primitive root of 11.
   Not every prime has a Fibonacci primitive root.
   There are 323 primes less than 10000 with one or more Fibonacci primitive
   roots and the sum of these primes is 1480491.
   Find the sum of the primes less than 100,000,000 with at least one
   Fibonacci primitive root.

   A group of p people decide to sit down at a round table and play a
   lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a
   randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when
   scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from Â£1 to Â£p,
   with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for each person to
   maximize his ticket winnings upon leaving the game.

   An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the
   table, each player has only one of two options:

   1. The player can scratch his ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at
   the table.
   2. The player can trade his unscratched ticket for a previous player's
   scratched ticket, and then leave the game with that ticket. The previous
   player then scratches his newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to
   everyone at the table.

   The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still
   remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.

   Assume that each player uses the optimal strategy for maximizing the
   expected value of his ticket winnings.

   Let E(p) represent the expected number of players left at the table when
   the game ends in a game consisting of p players (e.g. E(111)Â =Â 5.2912 when
   rounded to 5 significant digits).

   for an integer d.

   In each step, the ant at point (x[0], y[0]) chooses one of the lattice
   points (x[1], y[1]) which satisfy x[1] â‰¥ 0 and y[1] â‰¥ 1 and goes straight
   to (x[1], y[1]) at a constant velocity v. The value of v depends on y[0]
   and y[1] as follows:

     â€¢Â If y[0] = y[1], the value of v equals y[0].
     â€¢Â If y[0] â‰  y[1], the value of v equals (y[1] - y[0]) / (ln(y[1]) -
       ln(y[0])).

   The left image is one of the possible paths for d = 4. First the ant goes
   from A(0, 1) to P[1](1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1)) â‰ˆ 1.8205.
   Then the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 â‰ˆ 1.2283.
   From P[1](1, 3) to P[2](3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the
   required time is 2 / 3 â‰ˆ 0.6667. From P[2](3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant
   travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) â‰ˆ 1.8205 so the required
   time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 â‰ˆ 1.2283.
   Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.

   The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as
   0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest
   path for d = 4.

   Let F(d) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path.
   For example, F(4) â‰ˆ 2.960516287.
   We can verify that F(10) â‰ˆ 4.668187834 and F(100) â‰ˆ 9.217221972.

   Find F(10000). Give your answer rounded to nine decimal places.

   A 3-smooth number is an integer which has no prime factor larger than 3.
   For an integer N, we define S(N) as the set of 3-smooth numbers less than
   or equal to N . For example, S(20) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18 }.

   We define F(N) as the number of permutations of S(N) in which each element
   comes after all of its proper divisors.

   This is one of the possible permutations for N = 20.
   - 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 16, 6, 18, 12.
   This is not a valid permutation because 12 comes before its divisor 6.
   - 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 12, 16, 6, 18.

Problem 465

   The kernel of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the
   entire polygon's boundary is visible. We define a polar polygon as a
   polygon for which the origin is strictly contained inside its kernel.

   For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices.
   However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have
   zero area.

   For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the
   kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the
   origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):

   Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.

   Let P(n) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (x, y)
   have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than n.

   Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different
   set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon
   with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the polygon with
   vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].

   For example, P(1) = 131, P(2) = 1648531, P(3) = 1099461296175 and P(343)
   mod 1Â 000Â 000Â 007 = 937293740.

===========


   Consider a single game of Ramvok:

   Let t represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If t = 0, then
   the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn i, the player rolls a
   die. After rolling, if i < t the player can either stop the game and
   receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the
   roll and try again next turn. If i = t, then the roll cannot be discarded
   and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, t is chosen by the
   player, who must then pay an up-front cost ct for some constant c. For c =
   0, t can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of 0). Let R(d,
   c) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a
   single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die and cost
   constant c. For example, R(4, 0.2) = 2.65. Assume that the player has
   sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.

   Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:

   In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a
   slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration
   process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face
   has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If
   the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value.
   After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during
   such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on
   it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at
   all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are
   blank.

   Let S(d, c) be the expected profit that the player receives from an
   optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die to start
   (with all sides visible), and cost constant c. For example, S(6, 1) =
   208.3.

   Let F(n) = âˆ‘[4â‰¤dâ‰¤n] âˆ‘[0â‰¤câ‰¤n] S(d, c).

       chooses the leftmost choice.

   Note that due to rule 1, some seats will surely be left unoccupied, and
   the maximum number of people that can be seated is less than N (for N >

   Here are the possible seating arrangements for N = 15:

   We see that if the first person chooses correctly, the 15 seats can seat

   Let $\varphi$ be the golden ratio: $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$
   Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of
   powers of $\varphi$ even if we require that every power of $\varphi$ is
   used at most once in this sum.
   Even then this representation is not unique.
   We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive
   exponents are used and that the representation is finite.
   E.g: $2=\varphi+\varphi^{-2}$ and $3=\varphi^{2}+\varphi^{-2}$

   To represent this sum of powers of $\varphi$ we use a string of 0's and
   1's with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.
   We call this the representation in the phigital numberbase.
   So $1=1_{\varphi}$, $2=10.01_{\varphi}$, $3=100.01_{\varphi}$ and
   $14=100100.001001_{\varphi}$.
   The strings representing 1, 2 and 14 in the phigital number base are
   palindromic, while the string representating 3 is not.
   (the phigital point is not the middle character).

   The sum of the positive integers not exceeding 1000 whose phigital
   representation is palindromic is 4345.

   Find the sum of the positive integers not exceeding $10^{10}$ whose
